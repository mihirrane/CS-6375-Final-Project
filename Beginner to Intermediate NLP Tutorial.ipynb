Since so much of the data we have available is in the **major format of text,** this is exceedingly important to data science and for Industry !\n\n* A specific common application of **NLP** is each time you use a **language conversion tool.** This techniques used to **accurately convert text from one language to another**(Like **Google Translator**) very much falls under the umbrella of **\"natural language processing.\"**\n\n### 1.3 Why is NLP a \"hard\" problem? \n\n* The language is ambiguous. Once, the explanation of a person's sentence can be very different from another person's explanation. Because of this inability to be constantly clear, it is difficult to have a NLP technique that works perfectly.\n\n### 1.4 Glossary\n\nHere is some common terminology:\n\n<b>Corpus: </b> (Plural: Corpora) a collection of written texts that serve as our datasets.\n\n<b>nltk: </b> (Natural Language Toolkit) the python module we'll be using repeatedly; it has a lot of useful built-in NLP techniques.\n\n<b>Token: </b> a string of contiguous characters between two spaces, or between a space and punctuation marks.

For example, \n\n``` \n[Pp]ython or \\Python|python\n```\n\ncould represent either <i>python</i> or <i>Python</i>. Likewise, \n\n``` \n[0123456789]\n```\n\nwould represent a single integer digit. The pipe symbols are typically used for interchangable strings, such as in the following example:\n\n```\n\\dog|cat\n```\n\n### 3.4 Ranges\n\nIf we want a regular expression to express the disjunction of a range of characters, we can use a <b>dash</b>. For example, instead of the previous example, we can write \n\n``` \n[0-9]\n```\nSimilarly, we can represent all characters of the alphabet with \n\n``` \n[a-z]\n```\n\n### 3.5 Exclusions\n\nBrackets can also be used to represent what an expression <b>cannot</b> be if you combine it with the <b>caret</b> sign. For example, the expression \n\n``` \n[^p]\n```\nrepresents any character, special characters included, but p.\n\n### 3.6 Question Marks \n\nQuestion marks can be used to represent the expressions containing zero or one instances of the previous character. For example, \n\n``` \n<i>\\colou?r\n```\nrepresents either <i>color</i> or <i>colour</i>. Question marks are often used in cases of plurality. For example, \n\n``` \n<i>\\computers?\n```\ncan be either <i>computers</i> or <i>computer</i>. If you want to extend this to more than one character, you can put the simple sequence within parenthesis, like this:\n\n```\n\\Feb(ruary)?\n```\nThis would evaluate to either <i>February</i> or <i>Feb</i>.\n\n### 3.7 Kleene Star\n\nTo represent the expressions containing zero or <b>more</b> instances of the previous character, we use an <b>asterisk</b> as the kleene star. To represent the set of strings containing <i>a, ab, abb, abbb, ...</i>, the following regular expression would be used:  \n```\n\\ab*\n```\n\n### 3.8 Wildcards\n\nWildcards are used to represent the possibility of any character and symbolized with a <b>period</b>. For example, \n\n```\n\\beg.n\n```\nFrom this regular expression, the strings <i>begun, begin, began,</i> etc., can be generated. \n\n### 3.9 Kleene+\n\nTo represent the expressions containing at <b>least</b> one or more instances of the previous character, we use a <b>plus</b> sign. To represent the set of strings containing <i>ab, abb, abbb, ...</i>, the following regular expression would be used:  \n\n```\n\\ab+\n```"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f576cfa4118f295af0cd0df5c9382f88b0701409"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.0 Word Tagging and Models\n---\n\nAny phrase, you can classify each word as a noun, a verb, a conjunction or any other type of words.

Eli, who also took the same test, received an 89%. Lastly, Ojas received a 72%.\n```\nThis is clearly unstructured. It requires reading for any logical relationships to be extracted. Through the use of information extraction techniques, however, we could output structured data such as the following: \n\n```\nName     Grade\nMartin   98\nJacob    84\nEli      89\nOjas     72\n```\n\n## 3.0 Chunking<a id=\"30\"></a>\n\n---\nChunking is used for entity recognition and segments and labels multitoken sequences.

This can be performed using either rule-based systems, which typically look for specific patterns in the text that connect entities and the intervening words, or using machine learning systems that typically attempt to learn such patterns automatically from a training corpus.\n\n### 5.1 Rule-Based Systems<a id=\"51\"></a>\n\nIn the rule-based systems approach, we look for all triples of the form (X, a, Y), where X and Y are named entities and a is the string of words that indicates the relationship between X and Y. Using regular expressions, we can pull out those instances of a that express the relation that we are looking for. \n\nIn the following code, we search for strings that contain the word \"in\". The special regular expression `(?!\\b.+ing\\b)` allows us to disregard strings such as `success in supervising the transition of`, where \"in\" is followed by a gerund. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"45493934d662e54ae163a3c37358feedf495a01b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"IN = re.compile(r'.*\\bin\\b(?!\\b.+ing)')\nfor doc in nltk.corpus.ieer.parsed_docs('NYT_19980315'):\n    for rel in nltk.sem.relextract.extract_rels('ORG', 'LOC', doc,corpus='ieer', pattern = IN):\n        print (nltk.sem.relextract.rtuple(rel))","execution_count":47,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"[ORG: 'WHYY'] 'in' [LOC: 'Philadelphia']\n[ORG: 'McGlashan &AMP; Sarrail'] 'firm in' [LOC: 'San Mateo']\n[ORG: 'Freedom Forum'] 'in' [LOC: 'Arlington']\n[ORG: 'Brookings Institution'] ', the research group in' [LOC: 'Washington']\n[ORG: 'Idealab'] ', a self-described business incubator based in' [LOC: 'Los Angeles']\n[ORG: 'Open Text'] ', based in' [LOC: 'Waterloo']\n[ORG: 'WGBH'] 'in' [LOC: 'Boston']\n[ORG: 'Bastille Opera'] 'in' [LOC: 'Paris']\n[ORG: 'Omnicom'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']\n[ORG: 'DDB Needham'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']\n[ORG: 'Kaplan Thaler Group'] 'in' [LOC: 'New York']\n[ORG: 'BBDO South'] 'in' [LOC: 'Atlanta']\n[ORG: 'Georgia-Pacific'] 'in' [LOC: 'Atlanta']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b6d52ea5ef7cf6dfcd85e6b173d47321114bd57d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note that the X and Y named entitities types all match with one another!

But additionally, algorithms like Suport Vector Machines and Random Forest could also accomplish the job. Which algorithm you ultimately choose depends on which outperforms in terms of speed and accuracy.\n\nIn summary, it's important to note that while these algorithms will likely have high accurate rates, labeling thousands of relations (and entities!) is incredibly expensive.   \n\n\n## 6.0 Sentiment Analysis<a id=\"60\"></a>\n\n---\n\nAs we saw in the previous tutorial, sentiment analysis refers to the use of text analysis and statistical learning to identify and extract subjective information in textual data.
